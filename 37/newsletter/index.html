          <p>Welcome to the 2021 Butterfly Monitoring Season!  Whether you&rsquo;re brand new to butterfly monitoring or have monitored your route for some time, welcome!</p>
<p>Depending on your geographical location and the weather, you have either already started monitoring, or will be starting soon. Enjoy these early days of Spring, and remember, even if you see no butterflies during your first (or any) survey, do enter that into Pollardbase.  Absence of butterflies is also data!</p>
<h2 id="new-co-directors">New Co-Directors</h2>
<p>Please welcome two new co-drectors to the project.  Rebeca Leininger is handling establishing routes in Pollardbase.  Those of you who are new to the program will interact with her through <a href="mailto:butterflymonitorstx@gmail.com">butterflymonitorstx@gmail.com</a>. Ashley DeLeon and Irmi Willcockson will handle the volunteer side of the project.  All three of us monitor the gmail account, and will route your question/concern to the most appropriate person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for this inaugural newsletter.  Check back around September for the Summer issue with an update on the 2021 monitoring effort, and perhaps a photo or two!</p>
<p>Irmi Willcockson</p>
